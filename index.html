# Deploy TimeScale infrastructure

- From your hydroserver-ops repo,click Actions > Workflows > select "Create HydroServer Timescale Cloud Database".
- Run the workflow, providing your environment name.
    - **The Django credentials** you provide will be used to create a superuser you can use to log in to the Django admin dashboard. You can change these later if you wish.
    - **The partition interval** is used to chunk the HydroServer observations table.
    - **Version** If you want to use the latest version of HydroServer, leave this field blank.
- After the workflow completes, you should see a new service on your Timescale Cloud dashboard. To connect to this service, retrieve the Timescale database connection details from the output folder in the Terraform S3 bucket you created earlier.
- Create the following GitHub environment secret:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Use the database connection string from the Timescale connection details file you looked up in step 3.
